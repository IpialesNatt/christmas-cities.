# christmas-cities.
Quick exploration to christhmas cities from europ
This is a project that seeks to approach the creation of web pages in a simple way. That is why the current project seeks to offer the user an immersive experience and show how Christmas is experienced in different European cities, such as Paris, Madrid and Amsterdam at first. 

The goal is to increase the number of cities that can offer a magical experience to those people who like traveling and Christmas. This project seeks to be simple and easy to manage, which is why a simple header has been created, from where we can explore the cities that we want explorer. 

In addition, it has a gallery of images that seek to have an adequate size so that Christmas in the city can be observed well. 

The website https://dribbble.com/shots/23450645-ATIRA-Animation was used to inspiration the present proyect. 

Also, the "visual studio code" was used to do this firts part of proyect. There were used some extensions from this program: W3C Web Validator, XML and XML Tools

Weak points
As weak points we can highlight the limitation in terms of the offer of cities that we have, and the absence of images in HD or better quality. 

Future improvements
More knowledge and new tools will be acquired
We will seek to have a more dynamic website that is more attractive to the user
More cities will be added and with other exploration sections such as typical food and a map with the location of each interesting place.
